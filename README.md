#react-redux-todo
A very basic Todo app written with React / Redux that I created for a coding challenge.

## Technologies Used
* React.js
* Redux.js

## Machine Preparation
You will need Node.js installed and running in your local environment.
You will also need https://github.com/jaspervalero/todo-api-server which serves as the backend for this app.

## Usage
1. **Clone repo** - `git clone https://github.com/jaspervalero/react-redux-todo.git`
2. **Install dependencies** - `npm install` (1st time only)
3. **Launch app** - `npm run start`
4. **Access** via `http://localhost:8080/`
